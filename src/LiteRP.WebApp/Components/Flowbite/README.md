# Temporary Flowbite Integration

This directory contains a temporary and unorganized collection of C# classes and Blazor components copied from the [Flowbite-Blazor](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-blazor) library.

These components are intended for use in the LiteRP project but have not yet been properly structured or integrated. This is a work in progress.
